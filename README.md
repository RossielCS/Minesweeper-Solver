# Minesweeper Solver
> This project has as main objective to build an app that solves a board similar to the minesweeper game.<br />
The app takes an API and retrieves a random board, which is a two dimensional Array.
The application should replace all the white spaces with an integer representing the number of bombs near the element.<br />
Once the board is solved, the app will proceed to return an API with two properties, the problem, and the solution.
